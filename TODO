Things that are scheduled for Ant 1.6.2.  Once this list is empty, we
can roll the first beta.

Please go ahead and assign things that are not already assigned to
anybody else (assignments look like [Stefan]) to yourself - and please
remove items from this list once they are complete.

* Fix or at least document support for tomcat 5.0 jsp

* review claimed AntClassLoader memory leak [Stefan]

* <junitreport> and JDK 1.5 [Stefan hopes that Stephane solves it for
  him, otherwise he'll do it himself]

* AntClassLoader parent loader [Start thread, Peter]

* delete - do not follow symlinks [Peter, may be dropped for 1.6.2]
